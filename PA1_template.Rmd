## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r loading}
activity <- read.csv('activity.csv')
attach(activity);
head(activity);
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
indices <- 1:length(steps);
totals <- rep(0,288);
  head(steps);
  head(activity$steps)
  mean(activity$steps, na.rm=T)
  mean(steps, na.rm=T)
  
  for(i in 1:287) {
    totals[i] <- sum(steps[indices[which(indices %% 288 == i)]], na.rm=TRUE);
  }
  totals[288] <- sum(steps[indices[which(indices %% 288 == 0)]], na.rm=TRUE);
  totals;
plot(totals, type="l")
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
